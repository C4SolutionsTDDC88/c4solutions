## Download of project
1. Clone this repo. ``` git clone https://github.com/C4SolutionsTDDC88/c4solutions.git ```
2. Go into local repo. ``` cd c4solutions ```
3. Clone front-end-repo. ``` git clone https://github.com/C4SolutionsTDDC88/front-end.git ```
4. Clone back-end-repo. ``` git clone https://github.com/C4SolutionsTDDC88/back-end.git ```

## Start development server
**To be able to run the development environment one most have docker server installed and running.**
1. In a terminal see that c4solutions is your current working directory.
2. Run the command  ``` docker-compose up --build ```. *The --build flag is optional and should only be used if you have installed a new module (does not happen regularly).*

**NOTE:** At the first executing docker will need to download a lot of data. Therefore this can take up to five minutes depending on your internet speed.
